**Welcome to my blog!** As you may have gathered from my bio, my name is Josh and I've been working as a full-time Android software engineer for over a decade. I've started this blog to share and explore some of the topics that I find interesting, along with lessons that I've picked up throughout my career.

Invoking the header image for this post should give you a sense of how I feel about software development (*and if I'm being honest, life in general*). Even after many years in the field, my knowledge can feel like a Grand Canyon of missing information and experience. I'd like to use this blog as another method of exploring ways of bridging the gap to making me a more knowledgable and well-rounded software developer/person.

I'll be focusing mainly on Android and Kotlin development, since this is my specialty - but I'll likely detour into other topics from time to time. I work across all levels of the Android stack,  from data backends to complex UI (Jetpack Compose saved us all :pray:). On top of that, I'm a sucker for deep-diving into different methods of maintaining and optimizing Gradle build systems in large multi-module projects (check out my pet project [here](https://github.com/jsoberg/Android-Net-Info) that I use as a test-bed for build system experiments) and other more obscure Android related topics.

Thanks again for stopping in!
